# amibroker-payload
This project demonstrates the creation of an authentication bypass payload for the AmiDataTradingView plugin used in the AmiBroker program. The addresses used in this project were obtained through reverse engineering of AmiBroker, and the payload is crafted to modify the plugin's behavior by manipulating memory and process functions.
