# AmiDataTradingView Plugin Authentication Bypass Payload

This project demonstrates the creation of an authentication bypass payload for the AmiDataTradingView plugin used in the AmiBroker program. The addresses used in this project were obtained through reverse engineering of AmiBroker, and the payload is crafted to modify the plugin's behavior by manipulating memory and process functions.

## Features

- Dynamically loads and interacts with the `AmiDataTradingView.dll` library.
- Uses Windows APIs such as `VirtualProtectEx` and `WriteProcessMemory` to bypass authentication checks.
- Implements low-level memory management techniques to modify application behavior.
- Includes comprehensive use of reverse-engineered addresses to target specific functionalities in the plugin.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Compiler**: Microsoft Visual Studio or any compatible C++ compiler
- **Knowledge Requirements**: Familiarity with reverse engineering, Windows APIs, and memory manipulation techniques.

## How It Works

1. **Load the DLL**: The code loads `AmiDataTradingView.dll` dynamically using `LoadLibrary`.
2. **Identify Target Functions**: Using reverse-engineered addresses, the payload locates and manipulates target functions and memory locations.
3. **Modify Memory**: Windows APIs such as `VirtualProtectEx` and `WriteProcessMemory` are employed to bypass authentication mechanisms.
4. **Restore Protection**: After memory modifications, the original memory protection settings are restored to maintain application stability.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/orcus-x/amibroker-payload.git
   cd amibroker-payload
   ```
2. Compile the code using your preferred compiler:
   ```bash
   cl /EHsc main.cpp
   ```
3. Execute the compiled binary:
   ```bash
   main.exe
   ```
